# Air Collision Calculation Project - UNESC

This project, developed in VB.NET 4.8, calculates and determines if aircraft are on a collision course. Using information about the position, speed, and direction of the aircraft, the program analyzes possible intersections and determines if a collision will occur.

## Features

- **Aircraft CRUD**: Allows you to create, read, update, and delete aircraft data.
- **Position and Angle Calculation**: Calculates the radius and angle of the aircraft based on the provided coordinates.
- **Speed and Direction Calculation**: Allows the insertion and analysis of the aircraft's speed and direction.
- **Collision Analysis**: Determines if aircraft are on a collision course and calculates the time until a possible collision.
- **Graphic Visualization**: Aircraft are drawn on a panel for better visualization of routes and directions.

## How to Use

1. Enter the aircraft information (position, radius, angle, speed, and direction) into the text fields.
2. Use the provided buttons to add, translate, or scale the aircraft in space.
3. Press the collision calculation button to check for possible intersections between aircraft routes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a main class that manages the program's logic, including functions for angle calculation, radius, angular coefficient, and management of aircraft and collision lists.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET Framework 4.8**: Ensure that version 4.8 of the .NET Framework is installed in your environment.
